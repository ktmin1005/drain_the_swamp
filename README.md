Trying to pop the bubble that people who make all the important decisions that rule us.
This website aims to pop the bubble that politicians live in. There needs to be public outrage and movement for anything to be fixed. I understand people are angry, that's why MAGA existed in the first place, why people thought voting for an outsider was the solution. They are in some ways correct, both sides are in such a bubble of bribes and big money that everything seems to be going up. In fact, if you do have assets already, those values are only going up, but this only leads to a system in which teh rich get richer. I hope showing the flow of money will show how harmful this is. I openly accept criticism of my work, and I recognize that I can make mistakes, or use faulty information unwillingly.
